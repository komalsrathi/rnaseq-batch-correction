#### Purpose
Location of all relevant DMG/HGG project workflows. 

#### Structure
Should be arranged thematically with the following example structure: 

```./analyses/TMB/input```

```./analyses/TMB/output```

```./analyses/TMB/code```

```./analyses/TMB/Docker```

```./analyses/TMB/*.Rmd```

```./analyses/TMB/*.sh```

```./analyses/TMB/*.py```

In the above example, the code directory should contain all functions and modules, and all scripts used to run the modules/functions should be within the main TMB directory.
